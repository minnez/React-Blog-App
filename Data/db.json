For example in Chapter 8 the student can simply look atthe root locus and describe qualitatively the changes in transient response that willoccur as a system parameter such as gain is varied.

What is the most important idea that you are trying to convey to your reader? The information in each paragraph must be related to that idea. In other words, your paragraphs should remind your reader that there is a recurrent relationship between your thesis and the information in each paragraph. A working thesis functions like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas, will grow. The whole process is an organic oneâ€”a natural progression from a seed to a full-blown paper where there are direct, familial relationships between all of the ideas in the paper.",
